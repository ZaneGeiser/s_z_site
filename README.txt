Project Status:

Made it to 1:08:40 on video 13 for deploying a linux server with linode. getting a 403 Forbidden.
I will need to check the git file from corey to check spelling on all steps to see where I went wrong.
Will be a very frustrating debug I suspect.
Also, I need to remove the DJANGO_PRIVATE_KEY in setting from git hub somehow. add to .Bash_profile then clean the existing repo.
