        <hr />
        <h5 class="font-weight-light my-5 text-left">Sarah is from Canberra and Zane is from Hickory. If you don’t know
            where
            those places are, rest assured you’re part of a pretty extensive group. Long story short: they’re 10 000
            miles apart. We met while Sarah was studying abroad for a semester at Zane’s uni, UNC Chapel Hill.
            Fast-forward through 3 years of long-distance dating, a lengthy visa process and a beautiful wedding (in our
            humble opinions), we found ourselves living in Sydney with dreams of traveling the world at the end of 2020.
            But, as it turned out, 2020 was not the year for airports. Plan B saw us buy a van from a tourism company
            who wasn’t seeing huge amounts of tourists that year, spending six months converting it into a tiny home
            while working full time, and setting off on a trip around Australia in early 2021.</h5>

        <h5 class="font-weight-light my-5 text-left">Sarah is fun, energetic, and a magnetic character, especially on a
            stage (ask
            her to recite any line from
            The Parent Trap – she knows the whole script by heart). Zane is relaxed, industrious, and often excited by a
            good tomato (seriously – we have a 15 tomato restriction per shop).</h5>
        <h5 class="font-weight-light my-5 text-left">Together, we’ll be documenting anything that we find exciting. To
            be honest,
            for Sarah, this is most things.
            Our goal is to capture the joy we have in exploring and to tell a good story along the way.</h5>
        <h5 class="font-weight-light my-5 text-left">What’s next for us after this trip? We have no idea. Hopefully
            we’ll figure
            it out at some point over the
            next 12 months, but until then, more cheese please.</h5>
